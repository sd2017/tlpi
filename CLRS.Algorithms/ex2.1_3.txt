 * Consider the searching problem:
 * Input: A sequence of n numbers A = <a1, a2, ..., an> and a value v
 * Output: An index i such that v == A[i] or the special value NIL if v
 * does not appear in A.
 * Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence,
 * looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is
 * correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary
 * properties.
